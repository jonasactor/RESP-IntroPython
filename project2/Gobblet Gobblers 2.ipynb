    "### Make sure you have done _at least_ one of the following:\n",
    "- completed the Gobblet Gobblers 1 assignment.\n",
    "- read through and understood the solutions in Gobblet Gobblers 1 - Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your mission, should you choose to accept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the section \"Combinatorial game theory\" on the following Wikipedia page. Ask if you have any questions! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Combinatorial_game_theory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement your own minimax AI for Gobblet Gobblers, following the pseudocode on the Wikipedia page. Your implementation should be a function called `_get_movetree`, which is started for you in the cell below. You might find some of the functions you wrote in Gobblet Gobblers 1 helpful (such as the one for checking for a win).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Your function `_get_movetree` should take three arguments, `self, setup, k`:\n",
    "    - `self` is the instance of the `Game` to which this function belongs. Do not worry about this argument.\n",
    "    - `setup`** is a `tuple` with three entries: `setup = (board, stables, turn)`.\n",
    "        1. `board` is the same as in Gobblet Gobblers 1\n",
    "        2. `stables` is a `list` of length 2: `stables[0]` is the stable for the first player, while `stables[1]` is the stable for the second player.\n",
    "        3. `turn` is a `bool` keeping track of whether it is the second player's turn.\n",
    "    - `k` is the current recursion depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Your function `_get_movetree` should return a `tuple` with two entries `(score, setup)`.\n",
    "    - `score` is the value assigned for this node, unless `k==0`, where then the score is the maximal score.\n",
    "    - `setup` is the setup tuple passed as the argument into this function, unless `k==0`, where then return the setup whose score is maximal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the pseudocode provided, view each 'node' as a setup, which in our case is a `tuple` describing the current game state.\n",
    "- A **`tuple`** is very similar to a `list`, but uses **`( )`** instead of **`[ ]`**. The differences between the two are mostly how memory is managed and referenced \"under the hood\" of Python. You can loop over a `tuple` and find its length just like a `list`, but some of the other built-in functions (like finding the maximum or sorting) only work for `lists`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your function will be recursive. To call your function, instead of calliing `_get_movetree(self, setup, k)` like you would normally, you need to use `self._get_movetree(self, setup, k)`. _This has nothing to do with recursion in Python, instead this is because of the `Game` object that makes the game playable._\n",
    "- For testing, set a maximum depth of < 3. For running the code, use a maximum depth of <= 3. Recursing more than this will take a _really_ long time.\n",
    "- For testing, try playing the game! Run the function `playgame()` and see if this works. In the current base code, the AI does nothing on its turn, and its turn then ends.\n",
    "- Please read through the code in the other cells, and please ask questions about what this code does if there are steps you don't understand. Please don't mess with this code, otherwise there's a chance the game graphics engine won't be happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the \"children of this node\", i.e the next moves, use the function `get_current_moves` provided below. The function `get_current_moves` is given a setup tuple, and returns a list of new setups, each of which are valid, possible new setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign values at each \"node\", do the following:\n",
    "1. Check to see if the game has been won.\n",
    "2. If the game is over, assign a score of 1 if you (=current player) has won, or -1 if you lost.\n",
    "3. If the game is not over but you've reached the maximum depth, assign a score of 0."
