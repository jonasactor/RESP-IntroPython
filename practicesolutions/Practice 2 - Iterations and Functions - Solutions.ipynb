    "wordcounter(\" U.S. beats Spain with pair of Rapinoe penalties Megan Rapinoe, right, celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal for the U.S. against Spain. A pair of Megan Rapinoe penalty kicks handed the United States a 2-1 win against a tough Spain side on Monday, booking a spot in the quarterfinals of the Womens World Cup. Julie Ertz returned to the U.S. starting lineup against Spain after missing the last group-stage game with a hip contusion, and manager Jill Ellis went with Sam Mewis in place of Lindsey Horan. The U.S. and Spain traded goals inside of the first 10 minutes, with Rapinoe converting an early penalty before Jennifer Hermoso capitalized on sloppy play out of the back from the Americans and curled a shot past Alyssa Naeher. After conceding the early goal, the U.S. was by far the better side for most of the remainder of the first half, pinning Spain down and creating quality chances but failing to find the back of the net as the teams went to the break tied 1-1. You can talk tactics but heart, grit and resolve -- thats a big part of World Cup soccer. No game is ever easy in this tournament, said Ellis after the match. We know that, weve learned that. So part of it is the mental piece and I thought they were great tonight.\", \"goal\")"
