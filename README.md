This repository contains jupyter notebooks for an Introduction to Python course,

JAA would like to acknowledge materials, advice, and suggestions from the Python Bootcamp for Gene Golub Summer
School on Data Analytics and High Performance Computing, assembled by Rich Vuduc, June 2019, and also from Dan
Englund, of Rice University, who has instructed a similar course in previous years.
